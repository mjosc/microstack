Web api built in C#, Java, and Node +
  Client built in TypeScript with React = 
    Full-stack experience with .NET Core, Spring, and Express
```
This is a demonstration of a simple LMS web API with an accompanying front-end. It is an ongoing project with the purpose of gaining exposure to several core technologies used in full-stack development. The aim is to build the same web API across three different languages and web frameworks. A side-effect is practice with TypeScript and React.
